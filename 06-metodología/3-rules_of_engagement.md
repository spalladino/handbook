# Agile
We believe that producing Quality Software should not be a linear pre-defined process in the same way as constructing a building, but rather an organic process which resembles exploring an uncharted territory. For that reason we work with agile methodologies involving the customer in an active role at each step of the pro cress and crafting tangible results periodically. Those results are evaluated in regular cycles and the work for the next iteration planned on that basis. 

You should expect to:

1. Have a single point contact on our side that will act as the proxy for the team working on your projects.
1. Reciprocally, provide a product-owner on your side that will act as the point of contact with your organisation, centralise all requirements and have decision power. 
1. Make yourself available at least every 2 weeks for 2 hours to have a conversation with the team and come with an idea of what you’d like us to build next.
1. Be able to evaluate results at each cycle and provide feedback instead of deferring to a final evaluation. 
1. Allow us to explore possible solutions to the problems you perceive together with you, versus implementing your predefined specification.
1. Give yourself the freedom to change your mind about what needs to be built. Part of the beauty of the agile process is that you have the chance to reorient the progress at each cycle.
1. Respect the development cycle by requesting features and changes only during the planning sessions.


# Scope

We love what we do and want to be productive and put our hearts into what we deliver to you. There are few things that are not a good match for our skills, however in each of these we can either recommend a good fit for that or train somebody in your team to performance those activities:

1. We strive to make user friendly applications where the intended use is self-evident. While we can provide documentation for things where it’s need, like APIs, file formats, deployment instructions, we will not write a complete manual of the application. 
1. We have experience with implementing standards compliant software but we don’t have the resources to help you develop all the documentation that’s required to pass certification.
1. We will provide support of the application during the bootstrap process but we are not able to provide 24x7 real-time support. We can also be the second tier of support during the production phase.
1. We'd love working with your users during the requirements gathering process, user research and usability testing sessions [lingo] and we know that will create a much better final results. 


# How we work

1. We have a lovely office with all the tools we need to be effective and efficient, while collaborating with the wider team. We will gladly go to your offices for meetings and working sessions but we will not work on-site. By allowing us to work in our place, you not only get the expertise of the team assigned to your project but also the collective knowledge an experience of the whole organisation. 
1. We constantly refine and improve our development process. It’s likely our project is part of a bigger project in your organisation but we can’t commit to work inside your processes. If you feel there’s going to be a need to integrate with process requirements on your side, please let us know ahead so we can identify how to interface with it.
1. We strive for good coding and architecture practice. We can evaluate your existing application and provide a report on their overall health but we can’t guarantee that we will be able to continue the work other started before.
1. We pride ourselves in having experience on multiple technologies and platforms. We welcome any data-based debate on which technologies or architectural strategies are the best for the project. If you have in-house technical knowledge we can work with your team on exploring possible technical solutions but we reserve the right to choose what we believe will deliver the highest value for you.
1. To have a productive and creative team working for you, we maintain a healthy working load. It is only on very rare and specific occasions that we work extra-hours and weekends (such as Ebola outbreaks or 7.0M in the richter scale earthquakes [links])
